  - Scripted classes can now create static fields and functions.

## [0.5.3] - 2024-10-18
This patch resolves a critical issue that could cause user's save data to become corrupted. It is recommended that users switch to this version immediately and avoid using version 0.5.2.

### Fixed

- Fixed a critical issue in which the Stage Editor theme value could not be parsed by older versions of the game, resulting in all save data being destroyed.
  - Added a check that prevents save data from being loaded if it is corrupted rather than overwriting it.
- Converted `optionsStageEditor.theme`, `optionsChartEditor.theme`, and `optionsChartEditor.chartEditorLiveInputStyle` in the save data from an Enum to a String to fix save data compatibility issues.
  - In the future, Enum values should not be used in order to prevent incompatibilities caused by introducing new types to the save data that older versions cannot parse.
