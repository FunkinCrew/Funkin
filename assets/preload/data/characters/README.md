Notes to self:
- After the idle/sing animation finishes, the game immediately transitions to (and loops, if enabled in the JSON) the `-hold` animation.
  - In `dad.json` and `parents-christmas.json`, this is used to keep their eyes flickering during long notes.
  - In `mom-car.json`, this animation is used to keep her hair blowing while singing, and between bops of her idle.
