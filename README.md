## About FNFSL
FNFSL is a Friday Night Funkin' engine designed to not change everything about Friday Night Funkin' but still having new options and new features, Good for Modders who prefer a smaller engine that isn't terribly bloated with unnecessary options and features. Please keep in mind that this is being programmed by someone who isn't great at Haxe and can't do everything.
 
You can find it on GameJolt here: https://gamejolt.com/games/Friday-Night-Funkin-Sublime-Engine/702060

## But why should you use this engine?
Well let me list out a few reasons why:
* We listen to the users who use ths Engine and try to add whatever cool features you recommend us adding.
* We try to not give up while fixing bugs and adding features.
* We have Lite version of Week 7.
* We have Cutscene Support (Windows Only).
* We have a pretty good Input System.

If this hasn't convinced you, Then i don't mind. You really don't have to use this engine.

## Important Information
This engine was originally named "NUFNF (New Unnamed Friday Night Funkin' Engine)", We are in the process of changing the name.
