## Holy shit, FNF on mobile?

With this fan port we try and make it so FNF runs on mobile as if it was made FOR mobile gameplay. Coming toe-to-toe with what would be an official Friday Night Funkin’ mobile build! Little to no new features will be added unless it really really REALLY enhances the mobile experience.

Currently speaking, this mobile port can: Load videos, mods, visualize sounds, basically everything else the base game does!
