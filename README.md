## About FNFSL
FNFSL is a Friday Night Funkin' engine designed to not change everything about Friday Night Funkin' but still having new options and new features, Good for Modders who prefer a smaller engine that isn't terribly bloated with unnecessary options and features. Please keep in mind that this is being programmed by someone who barerly understands how to code in HaxeFlixel and can't do everything.
