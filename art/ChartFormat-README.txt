CHARTING FORMAT README
THIS FILE WILL CONSIST OF EXPLANATIONS OF THE CHARTING FORMAT
AS WELL AS A GENERAL CHANGELOG!!!

## [0.1.0] - [UNRELEASED]
### Changed
#### Converging things into one file, instead of three.
Old versions of FNF had their charts in 3 seperate files, for the 3 different difficulties. 
Now they are all in one file. They can be converted using the SongConverter script.

The songs are currently still in a JSON format, and should be easily convertable using the SongConverter script!
